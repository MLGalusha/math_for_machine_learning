# Notes for Linear Algebra and It's Applications
# Finish By: 07/25/2024

## Daily goal is to at least finish two sections per day
## Weekly goal is to complete 2 chapters per week.

### Additional notes
The goal isn't to go fast the goal is to learn as in depth as possible.
Taking this into account I will not be dissapointed if I don't reach the initial
daily and weekly. As long as I'm working everyday that is what matters. If I work
Everyday the material will eventually be learned in depth.

#### Main focus
The main focus is to learn in depth every single day at least 5 hours a day.
I'm doing this to learn linear algebra well not fast. They only thing that will
make it faster(in terms of weeks) is by spending more time on it.
